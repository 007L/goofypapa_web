    main3_2:"It was a world war that took place in Europe but spread all over the world.",

    main4_1:"During World War I, 1.5 million French soldiers were killed and at least one million British soldiers were lost. On the battlefield, artillery fire and corpses spread all over the country.",
    main4_2:"In the employment contracts of the British Weihai Recruitment Bureau and Chinese laborers, the Chinese laborers were unprepared to face the cruelty of the war, and were at a loss to withstand the vicissitudes of their fate.",
    main4_3:"Chinese laborers contributed a lot to the logistical support of the Allies. British Army Secretary Lloyd George was surprised at the strength of the Chinese laborers, who still walked with a load of 3,400 pounds.",
    main4_4:"Yan Yangchu, a graduate of Yale University, went to Europe as an official of YMCA to help Chinese workers.

During World War I, China dispatched 140,000 laborers, freeing the laborers of Britain, France and other countries from the heavy labor in the rear, which strongly guaranteed the victory of the Allies.",
    main4_7:"The blood and tears of 140,000 Chinese laborers did not enhance China's international status. At the Paris Conference, China won only two representative seats, and Japan constantly questioned China's eligibility to participate in the conference, trying to exclude China from the conference. For its own benefit, Britain and France transferred Germany's privilege to Japan in Shandong, China, and the news was sent back to Japan. Internally, the Chinese people were so excited that the May 4th Movement broke out in the end.",
    main4_8:"Towards the end of World War I, Britain forced the repatriation of sick Chinese workers, and hastily repatriated them after victory. In 1920, the last batch of British recruits returned to Qingdao, which was controlled by the Japanese army. They guarded the homes of the British and the French, but the British and the French betrayed their homes.",

Contribution of 140,000 workers to China. Fortunately, after years of raising funds, the first monument to Chinese workers in Britain, entitled 'Let's remember', will be officially unveiled in September 2018.",
